# Proof of Concept Project: Storing sources according to relevant connections.
This repositry is my proof of concept project for FOAR705, session 2 2019.
It contains a project which corresponds to a documented workflow process which aims to make the research process and publishing for efficient for students, academics and researchers in the social sciences. \\ 
It contains a project that can be used for identifying common themes between multiple sources at once and then storing them where relevant tags and annotations can be added. 
The aim of this project is to make finding and storing multiple sources (such as peer reviewed journal articles) more efficient for researchers.
#In this repositry
This repositry includes the project management tools, including user stories, to test the efficiency of this process.
