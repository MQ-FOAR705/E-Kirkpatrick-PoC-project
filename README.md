# Proof of Concept Project: Storing sources according to relevant connections.
This repositry is my proof of concept project for FOAR705, session 2 2019.
It contains a project which corresponds to a documented workflow process which aims to make the research process and publishing for efficient for students, academics and researchers in the social sciences.<br />
In this project sources, and the appropriate metadata, can be saved onto a localised storage program (Zotero), directly from an online database. They can then be transferred to Voyant tools (open via a web browser) which can identify shared themes, terms and other commonalities between sources. <br />
This provides insight for researchers and allows them to annotate and group sources within the storage program accordingly so that they can access them in later stages of the research process with no information or insights lost. This also makes it easier for additional collaborators in the research process to access information. <br />

## In this repositry
This repositry includes the project management tools, including user stories, to test the efficiency of this process. <br />
It also includes the appropriate licensing requirements. <br />
It also contains submodules which link to repositries containing the workflow process of this proof of concept project and the related original software publication. 

### Description of softwares and programs
Voyant tools - an open-source, web-based application that performs text analysis. <br />
Zotero - an open-source reference management software that manages bibliographic data and source materials which is free to install.
