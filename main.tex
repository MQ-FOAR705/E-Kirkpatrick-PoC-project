\section{Aim}
Further to my scoping and elaboration, I will focus on the tools that can be used to identify common themes between multiple sources from different databases and how they can be stored in the same place with their metadata, so that additional annotations can be added and they can have shared labels.

\section{User Stories}
\subsection{Identify commonalities}
As a research student, I would like a program which can compare multiple sources at once to identify common themes and terms. This will help determine relevance of source to project.
\subsection{Extract information}
As a research student, I would like a storage program that can extract source and metadata from an online platform so I can create references and citations more efficiently.
\subsection{Store sources}
As a research student, I would like a program that can store multiple sources with metadata so I can access all research material in the same place. 
\subsection{Add annotations}
As a research student, I would like to be able to add annotations to stored sources so they can be referred to more easily in the future.
\subsection{Group sources together}
As a research student, I would like to link specific sources through tags or labels so they can be grouped together. 
\subsection{Export metadata}
As a research student, I would like to export metadata to a publishing program, such as Microsoft Word, in order to automate the reference list.
